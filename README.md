### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gigi Sung (she/her), and I'm a spatial data analyst with a keen interest in the art of mapping anything and everything.

- Recently, I've become fascinated by satellite imagery and its transformative role in strategic planning. A big shout-out to Dr. Qiusheng Wu for granting access to incredible tools like geemap and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). ~~Check out related insights at "earth_observation."~~

- Dive into "transportation" for a curated collection of summaries and case studies in transportation economics and policy.
- Explore "arcgis_python" to see my python scripts automating spatial operations in Arcgis Pro.
- See "north_korea_datadrought" for a remote sensing project in North Korea. This will be developed into "post-disaster".
- Peek into "sandbox" for an eclectic mix of side projects in their nascent stages.
- "spatial_statics" coming up.
- The others are forked from insipring projects.  

I try to maintain clarity and order here, but should you encounter any chaos, please extend some grace to this diligent grad student's workspace.
